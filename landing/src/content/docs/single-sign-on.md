title: Single sign-on
description: Let members sign in with Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, or your own OIDC provider.
---

Members can sign in with Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, or one OIDC
provider (Okta, Authentik, Keycloak, Zitadel, Pocket ID and others). Each
provider you configure adds a **Continue with …** button on the sign-in page.
Email and password sign-in and invites keep working.

## Who gets in

- **Existing members** sign in with any provider whose email matches their
  account. The first SSO sign-in links it, removes the account's password
  and any other SSO link, signs out its other sessions, and revokes its
  [access tokens](/docs/mcp/#access): nobody verified the email behind those.
  An admin can give the password back with a
  [reset link](/docs/members/#reset-a-password). A first sign-in with a
  second provider does the same to the first provider's link.
- **New people** get an account on their first sign-in only if their email
  domain is in `SSO_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`. Everyone else needs an
  [invite link](/docs/members/#invite-someone). Without `SSO_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`,
  SSO only signs in existing members.

Each provider limits who can claim a domain:

- **Google:** only Workspace accounts of that domain. A personal Google
  account that uses a work address does not count.
- **Microsoft:** only accounts in the one tenant you set.
- **OIDC:** every account your provider signs in. Limit access to the
  application in your provider. The provider must send
  `email_verified: true`, or existing members cannot link their accounts.

Deleting a member does not stop them from signing in again with SSO: an
allowed domain recreates the account. Remove them in your provider too.

## Profile photos

A member who signs in with SSO shows their provider's profile photo: in the
sidebar, the member list, on Team drawings they made, and on the canvas and
live badges when they are in a drawing. Guests on a share link see it too.
Each sign-in refreshes the photo, but not the name or email: those stay as the
member set them in the app. Members without a photo show their initials.

Google and OIDC photos load from the provider's own URL, so each viewer's
browser asks the provider for the image. Microsoft sends the photo itself, and
the app stores it.

## Set it up

1. Set `BASE_URL` to the public URL.
2. Register this redirect URI with the provider:
   `<BASE_URL>/api/auth/callback/<id>`, where `<id>` is `google`,
   `microsoft`, or `oidc`.
3. Set the provider's variables below, then restart the app.

Set all the variables of a provider, or none: the app does not start with
some of them missing. PR previews ignore these settings.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SSO_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated email domains whose people join on their first sign-in, e.g. `acme.com,acme.de` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client of type **Web application** from Google Cloud Console (**APIs & Services → Credentials**) |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` | App registration in Microsoft Entra admin center, with a **Web** redirect URI. The tenant ID is the **Directory (tenant) ID**. `common`, `organizations` and `consumers` are refused. The app asks for `openid`, `profile`, `email` and `User.Read` (for the profile photo), not `offline_access` |
| `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | Confidential client in your provider. The issuer is the URL that serves `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| `OIDC_NAME` | Button label, e.g. `Okta` (default `SSO`) |

## Publish the Google app

In **Testing** status, only the test users you list can sign in. To let your
whole domain in, publish the app (**In production**). An app with only the
basic scopes (`openid`, `email`, `profile`) needs no Google verification
review, but Google first needs these on the **Branding** page:

- a home page link
- a privacy policy link
- an authorized domain

## Invites and passwords

An invite link always makes a password account: the invite page has no SSO
buttons. The invited person can then use **Continue with Google** (or another
provider) with the same email. This links the account and removes its
password, as for any existing member.

A member who only uses SSO has no password, so they cannot change their email
or password under **Settings**, then **Account**. An admin can give them a
password with a [reset link](/docs/members/#reset-a-password).
