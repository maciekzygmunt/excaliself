description: The settings of a deployment. Docker Compose takes them from .env, and Coolify sets the required ones for you.

## Core

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Yes | — | Database password. Use hex (`openssl rand -hex 24`): it goes into a connection URL |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | — | Auth signing secret, min 32 chars (`openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `BASE_URL` | In production | `http://localhost:3000` | Public URL users open in the browser. Auth rejects sign-ins from any other origin |
| `EXCALISELF_VERSION` | No | `latest` | Image tag to run: `latest`, a release like `1.2.3` or `1.2`, or `main` |
| `EXCALISELF_PORT` | No | `3000` | Host port for the app. `127.0.0.1:3000` keeps it local to a reverse proxy |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | No | `excaliself` | Database user |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | No | `excaliself` | Database name |

`docker-compose.yaml` builds `DATABASE_URL` for the app from the Postgres values.
To use your own Postgres, change `DATABASE_URL` in the compose file.

`GET /api/health` returns `200` when the app is up and can reach Postgres.

## Previews

For throwaway pull request instances. See
[PR previews](https://github.com/maciekzygmunt/excaliself/blob/main/docs/pr-previews.md).

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PREVIEW_MODE` | `true` runs an in-memory PGlite instead of Postgres, seeded with an admin and example drawings. It ignores `DATABASE_URL` and `BASE_URL` and makes `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` optional. Data is lost on restart |
| `PREVIEW_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hosts a preview answers on, e.g. `*.draw.example.com`. Auth refuses other hosts; localhost always works |
