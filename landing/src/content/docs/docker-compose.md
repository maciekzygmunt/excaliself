description: Run the prebuilt image behind a reverse proxy, pin a version, and upgrade.
---

Excaliself ships as a prebuilt multi-arch (amd64, arm64) image:

```
ghcr.io/maciekzygmunt/excaliself
```

| Tag | Tracks |
|---|---|
| `latest` | Newest release |
| `1.2.3` | That exact release |
| `1.2` | Newest `1.2.x` patch |
| `main` | Tip of `main` (unreleased, may break) |

The app needs PostgreSQL. `docker-compose.yaml` starts both. The app runs
database migrations on startup, so upgrading is pulling a newer image and
restarting. `GET /api/health` returns 200 when the app is serving and Postgres
is reachable; the image uses it as its container healthcheck.

See the [Quick start](/docs/) for the install commands and
[Environment variables](/docs/environment/) for every setting.

## Reverse proxy

Postgres is not published on the host; only the app port is
(`EXCALISELF_PORT`, default `3000`). On a public server, put a reverse proxy
with TLS (Caddy, Traefik, nginx) in front of it and set `BASE_URL` to the
public `https://` URL. Auth rejects sign-ins from any other origin. Set
`EXCALISELF_PORT=127.0.0.1:3000` to keep the app port local to the proxy.

Live collaboration and all Team drawings use WebSockets on the app port, under
`/ws/`, so the proxy must pass them through. Caddy and Traefik do this by default:

```
draw.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}
```

nginx needs the upgrade headers. Its default 1 MB body limit is also too small
for images:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  client_max_body_size 32m;
}
```

## Upgrade or pin a version

```bash
# optional: pin in .env, e.g. EXCALISELF_VERSION=1.2.3
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Drawings live in the `pgdata` volume, which survives upgrades and
`docker compose down`. `docker compose down -v` deletes it.

Take a [backup](/docs/backup-restore/) before each upgrade. There are no down
migrations, so restoring it is the safe way back to the older version.

## Build from source

To build the image on the server instead of pulling it (needs ~4 GB RAM),
clone the repo and run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

`docker-compose.build.yaml` alone publishes no port; `docker-compose.yaml` adds
it.
