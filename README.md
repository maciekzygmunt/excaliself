## Features

- **The full Excalidraw editor**, with auto-save. Images pasted into a drawing are stored too.
- **Live collaboration.** Share a drawing by link and edit it together in real time, with live cursors and follow mode. Links can be for members only or for anyone, including guests without an account.
- **Team space.** A shared space every member can see and edit, next to each member's private space. Team drawings are always live.
- **Folders, stars, and recents.** Nest folders and drag drawings between them in the sidebar.
- **Search** by title and by the text inside drawings, in the gallery and the command palette (<kbd>⌘K</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl K</kbd>), which also runs actions.
- **Trash** with restore. Deleted items are purged automatically after 30 days.
- **Invite-only accounts.** The first visitor creates the admin account; everyone else joins by invite link.
- **Admin tools** under Settings: manage members and roles, create password-reset links, and see instance stats.
- **Light and dark themes**, with an optional separate theme for the canvas.

## Deploy

Both paths run the app and its Postgres database together from one compose file.
They pull the prebuilt image `ghcr.io/maciekzygmunt/excaliself`
(amd64 and arm64), so nothing is built on your server. `latest` is the newest
release. The app applies database migrations when it starts, so updating is a
redeploy.

### Docker Compose

```bash
mkdir excaliself && cd excaliself
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maciekzygmunt/excaliself/main/docker-compose.yaml
curl -fsSL -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maciekzygmunt/excaliself/main/.env.example
# set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, and BASE_URL in .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open `BASE_URL` (default <http://localhost:3000>). The first visit takes you to
`/setup` to create the admin account. Postgres is not published on the host.
Put a reverse proxy with HTTPS in front of port 3000 for anything public.

To update, run `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. To pin a release,
set `EXCALISELF_VERSION` (e.g. `1.0.0`) in `.env`. To build the image from
source instead (needs about 4 GB of RAM), clone the repo and run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.build.yaml up -d --build`.
[docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md) has the details.

### Coolify

1. Add a new resource from the public repository
   `https://github.com/maciekzygmunt/excaliself`, branch `main`.
2. Choose the **Docker Compose** build pack and set **Docker Compose Location** to
   `/docker-compose.coolify.yaml`.
3. Click **Deploy**.

Coolify creates the database, generates the secrets, and assigns a domain, so
there is nothing to configure. If your server has no wildcard domain, first set a
domain on the `excaliself` service with the container port, e.g.
`https://draw.example.com:3000`. Open the domain to create the admin account.
To pin a release instead of `latest`, set
`EXCALISELF_VERSION` (e.g. `1.0.0`) in the resource's environment variables.
Drawings live in the `pgdata` volume and survive redeploys.

### Configuration

Docker Compose reads these from `.env`. Coolify sets them for you.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password for the bundled Postgres. Use hex (`openssl rand -hex 24`): it goes into a connection URL |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Session signing secret, at least 32 characters (`openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `BASE_URL` | Yes in production | Public URL of the instance (default `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `EXCALISELF_VERSION` | No | Image tag to run: `latest` (default), a release like `1.0.0` or `1.0`, or `main` |
| `EXCALISELF_PORT` | No | Host port for the app (default `3000`). `127.0.0.1:3000` keeps it local to a reverse proxy |
| `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB` | No | Bundled Postgres user and database (default `excaliself`) |
| `PREVIEW_MODE` | No | `true` runs a throwaway instance for a pull request preview: an in-memory PGlite instead of Postgres, seeded with an admin and example drawings. It ignores `DATABASE_URL` and `BASE_URL` and makes `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` optional. `/preview/login` signs in as the admin (`admin@example.com` / `preview-password`), `/preview/login?account=new` as a new member. Data is lost on restart. See [PR previews](./docs/pr-previews.md) |
| `PREVIEW_HOSTS` | With `PREVIEW_MODE` behind a domain | Comma-separated hosts a preview answers on, e.g. `*.draw.example.com`. Auth refuses other hosts; localhost always works |

`GET /api/health` returns `200` when the app is up and can reach Postgres.

If the only admin loses their password, see
[break-glass recovery](./docs/break-glass-recovery.md).

## Local development

Requires Node 22, pnpm, and Docker.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.dev.example .env                           # works as-is
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d    # Postgres on 127.0.0.1:5432
pnpm dev                                           # http://localhost:3000
```

`pnpm dev:preview` needs no Postgres and no `.env`: it runs in preview mode
(see `PREVIEW_MODE` above). Open `/preview/login`.

`pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm lint` run the checks.
`pnpm db:generate` creates a migration after a schema change.
Releases are cut from git tags; see [docs/releasing.md](./docs/releasing.md).
